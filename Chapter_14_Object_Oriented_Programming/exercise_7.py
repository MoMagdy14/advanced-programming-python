"""
Use the Standard_deck class of this section to create a simplified version of the game War.
In this game, there are two players. Each starts with half of a deck. The players each deal
the top card from their decks and whoever has the higher card wins the other playerâ€™s cards
and adds them to the bottom of his deck. If there is a tie, the two cards are eliminated from
play (this differs from the actual game, but is simpler to program). The game ends when one
player runs out of cards.
