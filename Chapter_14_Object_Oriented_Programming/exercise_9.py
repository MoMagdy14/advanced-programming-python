"""
Write a class called Rock_paper_scissors that implements the logic of the game Rock-paper-
scissors. For this game the user plays against the computer for a certain number of
rounds. Your class should have fields for how many rounds there will be, the current
round number, and the number of wins each player has. There should be methods for getting
the computerâ€™s choice, finding the winner of a round, and checking to see if someone has won
the (entire) game. You may want more methods.
